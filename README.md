# BMI Analysis for Children - Kaggle Dataset

## Overview
This project analyzes Body Mass Index (BMI) for children using a dataset from Kaggle. BMI is a crucial metric used to assess a child's growth and overall health. The analysis explores trends, distributions, and correlations in BMI data to provide insights into childhood obesity, underweight concerns, and normal growth patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key attributes:
- **Age**: Age of the child in years.
- **Height**: Height of the child in centimeters or meters.
- **Weight**: Weight of the child in kilograms.
- **BMI**: Calculated using the formula: `BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)^2`
- **Category**: Classification into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese based on standard BMI percentile ranges.

## Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handle missing or incorrect values.
   - Convert units if necessary.
   
2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of BMI values.
   - Histogram of Age, Weight, and Height.
   - Boxplots to detect outliers.

3. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation between BMI and other factors (Age, Height, Weight).
   - Scatter plots and regression analysis.
   - BMI category distribution by Age.

## Methodology
- **Data Processing**: Using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to clean and preprocess the data.
- **Visualization**: Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation and regression modeling.

## Key Findings
- BMI tends to increase with age, but the trend varies based on height and weight.
- Higher BMI categories (Overweight & Obese) are more prevalent in certain age groups.
- Strong correlation between weight and BMI, while height plays a moderating role.

## Future Improvements
- Including additional demographic factors such as gender and socioeconomic status.
- Applying machine learning models to predict BMI category based on input features.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore and analyze the data.
3. Modify the analysis to suit specific research needs or add new features.
